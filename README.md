# hello-world
This is my first repo


JT here!  

I Have been working in IT for 13 years as a Business Analyst and recently 
decided to add another tool to the shed by developing software.

For years I have been gathering requirements on how to build software for my business partners and stakeholders, learned how to read several different code bases but never actually took the time to learn how to program the requirements I was writing up.

I am fortunate enough to be working in an extreme programming model at work which is helping
a great deal.  There is nothing better than hands on keyboard time.

In order to make sure I don't lose passion for what I am doing I am practicing
as much as possibly can at home.

This repo is a work in progress and a learning tool for myself and hopefully for others
just starting out.
