# hello-world
This is my first repo


JT here!  

I Have been working in IT for 13 years as a Business Analyst and recently 
decided to add another tool to the shed and get into software development.

I am fortunate enough to be working in an extreme programming model at work which is helping
a great deal.  There is nothing better than hands on keyboard time.

In order to make sure I don't lose passion for what I am doing I am practicing
as much as possibly can at home.

This repo is a work in progress and a learning tool for myself and hopefully for others
just starting out.
