# hello-world
This is my first repo


JT here!  Have been working in the IT profession for 13 years as a Business Analyst and recently 
decided to add another tool to the shed and get into software development.

I am fortunate enough to be working in an extreme programming model at work which is helping
a great deal. In order to make sure I don't lose passion for what I am doing I am practicin
as much as possibly can at home.

This repo is a work in progress and a learning tool.
